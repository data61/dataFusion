
I’ve tried to cover all different types of unstructured data.  In gathering this exemplar data, I’ve seen:
	Emails
	Word documents
	Excel documents
	PDF documents
	HTML pages
	Image files
	Powerpoint files

Apart from their traditional uses such as data in excel and word processing in word documents, they also contain:
	Scanned images
	drivers licenses
	passports
	documents with/without signatures and stamps
	Company logos
	Screen dumps of internet searches
